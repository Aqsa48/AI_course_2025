# Arithmetic Operators in Python

Arithmetic operators in Python are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. Below is a list of arithmetic operators along with examples of how they are used.

## 1. Addition (`+`)
The addition operator `+` is used to add two numbers.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 5
result = x + y
print(result)  # Output: 15
```

## 2. Subtraction (`-`)
The subtraction operator `-` is used to subtract one number from another.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 5
result = x - y
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

## 3. Multiplication (`*`)
The multiplication operator `*` is used to multiply two numbers.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 5
result = x * y
print(result)  # Output: 50
```

## 4. Division (`/`)
The division operator `/` is used to divide one number by another. It always returns a float.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 5
result = x / y
print(result)  # Output: 2.0
```

## 5. Floor Division (`//`)
The floor division operator `//` divides two numbers and rounds down to the nearest integer.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 3
result = x // y
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

## 6. Modulus (`%`)
The modulus operator `%` returns the remainder of a division operation.

### Example:
```python
x = 10
y = 3
result = x % y
print(result)  # Output: 1
```

## 7. Exponentiation (`**`)
The exponentiation operator `**` is used to raise a number to a certain power.

### Example:
```python
x = 2
y = 3
result = x ** y
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

# Tasks Related to Arithmetic Operators

## **Lab Tasks**
1. Write a Python program to take two numbers as input and perform all arithmetic operations on them.
2. Create a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
3. Write a Python script to find the remainder when one number is divided by another.
4. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle using the formula: `Area = Ï€ * r^2`.
5. Implement a program that takes a number as input and returns its square and cube using exponentiation.
6. Create a simple calculator in Python that allows the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, etc.) and inputs two numbers.
